### Case Study: Fast Food Analysis

**Step 1: Data Exploration**
- Conducted a principal components analysis to understand consumer views on McDonald's.
- Found that price (cheap vs. expensive) and overall sentiment (positive vs. negative) were the main dimensions.

**Step 2: Segment Identification Using K-means Clustering**
- Tested clustering solutions from 2 to 8 segments.
- Selected a 4-segment solution based on stability analysis, though Segment 1 was less stable.

**Step 3: Validation with Mixture Models**
- Used an alternative method to confirm findings.
- The 4-segment solution aligned well with the k-means results.

**Step 4: Segment Analysis with Regression Models**
- Examined factors influencing consumer preferences.
- Identified two main segments with distinct drivers:
  1. Segment 1 values taste, speed, affordability, and deliciousness.
  2. Segment 2 values taste, convenience, and healthiness.

**Step 5: Marketing Strategy Interpretation**
- Recognized different perceptions and motivations across segments.
- Proposed customized marketing messages:
  - Segment 1: Emphasize taste, speed, and cost-effectiveness.
  - Segment 2: Highlight convenience and healthier options.

**Step 6: Segment Profiling**
- Created visual profiles to show key traits of each segment.
- Identified four distinct segments:
  1. Cheap and greasy
  2. Disgusting and costly
  3. Expensive but tasty and delicious
  4. Delicious, affordable, and somewhat healthy

**Step 7: Segment Description**
- Analyzed demographics like age, gender, and McDonald's affinity.
- Found associations with segment membership:
  - Segment 2 has more men; Segment 4 has more women.
  - Segment 3 tends to be younger.
  - Segment 4 has the highest affinity for McDonald's; Segment 2 the lowest.

**Step 8: Target Segment Selection**
- Created a plot based on visit frequency and preference.
- Identified Segments 3 and 4 as most attractive (frequent visitors with high preference).
- Noted improvement potential in Segment 1.

**Step 9: Customizing the Marketing Mix**
- For Segment 3 (young customers who like McDonald's but find it pricey):
  - Launch a "McSuperBudget" line (Product and Price).
  - Use popular channels among young people for promotion (Promotion).
  - Consider special "McSuperBudget" lanes in stores (Place).

**Step 10: Evaluation and Monitoring**
- Regularly monitor segment changes (e.g., Segment 3's income growth).
- Stay aware of broader market trends (e.g., new competitors).
- Adjust strategy based on continuous evaluation.
